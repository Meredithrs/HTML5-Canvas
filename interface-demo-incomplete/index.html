	<h1>HTML5 RuneScape Interface Demo with Basic Functionality</h1>
	<p>Besides obvious asset issues, this works basically how I want it to. This is actually four canvases: the main window, the chat box, the minimap, and the main interface. The advantage is that I don't need to clear everything to redraw one module, which does a really good job at preventing flickering. My only concern is being able to request map sets in time. Hopefully preloading a 3x3 set of maps will be enough. I'll likely worry about this last, though, as I'm currently a lot more interested in the interface.</p>
